      <h1>Keep Talking Nobody Explodes</h1>
      <p>Find yourself trapped alone in a room with a ticking time bomb.</p>
      <p>Your friends have the manual to defuse it, but they can't see the bomb, so you're going to have to talk it out – fast!</p>
      <h3>About the game</h3>
      <p>In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is trapped in a virtual room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. 
        The other players are the “Experts” who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the bomb defusal manual. 
        But there’s a catch: the experts can’t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out – fast!</p>
      <p>Rounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud. 
        Everybody has a role to play whether they are defusing the bomb or not. 
        Swap out between rounds and share the experience with all of your friends!</p>
      <p>Puzzle solving and communication skills - and maybe a few friendships - 
        will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively.</p>
