      <h1>The Micro-bit</h1>
      <p>This little device has an awful lot of features, like 25 red LED lights that can flash messages. 
        There are two programmable buttons that can be used to control games or pause and skip songs on a playlist. 
        Your BBC micro:bit can detect motion and tell you which direction you’re heading in, 
        and it can use a low energy Bluetooth connection to interact with other devices and the Internet – clever!</p>
      <p>The Micro Bit itself is a circuit board measuring just 50x40mm with two buttons and an array of 25 red LEDs in a 5x5 arrangement. 
        It will come in various colours, including green and blue.
        Kids can program the board via a web-based interface to do many things, including flashing up numbers, letters and scrolling messages on the LEDs. 
        Plus, since there’s a built-in accelerometer and compass, it can detect movement and tell which way it’s pointing.
        The buttons can control games, or even control music playback on another device such as a phone. 
        It can do this because it has on-board Bluetooth, so it can communicate with other Bluetooth devices including tablets, 
        cameras and the increasing number of smart home gadgets.</p>

      <p>There are also five rings which work with crocodile clips or 4mm banana plugs. 
        Using these, kids can attach more sensors including thermometers, moisture sensors, proximity sensors and more.
        The Micro Bit can also send signals to the rings to control motors, robots and other things.
        Those gold markings aren’t just for show: the entire edge of the Micro Bit is a ‘standard’ edge 
        connector which allows it to connect to a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Galileo or Kano.</p>
