      <p><u>The Micro-bit Maze</u></p>
      <p>https://makecode.microbit.org/_1WqFT2MuAcw2</p>
      <p>Micro bit maze is an exhilarating game which requires much skill, intense concentration and patience with communication. 
        To succeed you must complete many mazes, using the directions given by the manual. 
        Each time the maze refreshes so do the controls, making the game extremely difficult. 
        This is related to extreme communication skills from the diffuser to the controller where the information 
        needed is contained in the manual.</p>
      <p><u>LED Sequence</u></p>
      <p>URL</p>
      <p>The next game is LED sequence, which is a psychedelic and addictive sequence game which drives you to addiction and submission.
        To disarm the bomb this time, you must press or do specific things to stop the Led sequence. 
        Additionally, you rely on the holder of the manual to do this, who must match the LED to a definition or 
        physics related statement to work out which is the command. 
        This adds on the pressure for both parties who must work quickly and efficiently together to ensure that the correct 
        direction or command is achieved in the time limit. 
        This game will therefore confuse and disorientate even the most experienced player.</p>
      <p><u>Dance Dance Do</u></p>
      <p>https://makecode.microbit.org/_TDpDTg6YdF6F</p>
      <p>The final game to complete is dance dance do, which is an electronic dance game which will have players 
        itching to do the wrong thing but searching for the right. 
        The idea includes several tones sent from the device which will then dictate the action to do to disarm the bomb. 
        However, these tones sent don’t corresponded to an action, but rather the popularity position of an android programming 
        language, which then must be worked out to understand what is going on. 
        This then relates to position and therefore the number of lights. 
        This means that all of the games are complex and different, having varying lengths and game play instructions, 
        making the whole thing even more comically confusing.</p>
